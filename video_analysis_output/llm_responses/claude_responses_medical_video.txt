 RFK Jr. just revealed to members of Congress that he wants every American to be wearing a government bag menaculableized like a health tracker within the next four years. Yeah and this is from the same guy who's been scaring people off of vaccines, masks and even fucking Tylenol because apparently the government can't be trusted with the health of your body. What he wants is for the Department of Health and Human Services to push this plan with one of the biggest advertising campaigns in history. Mr. Evil Bill Gates tracking ship in the vaccine now wants to strap a federally sponsored fit bit on your ass. Does he even listen to himself speak? Does he know who his supporters are? Oh and by the way that people helping him design this plan they've also got financial sakes in the wearable tech industry. So when Bobby here is talking about health freedom what he really means is his friends cashing in while you're uploading your blood sugar to the cloud. You don't get to run for president or help run in office on paranoid delusions and they turn around and tell everyone to wear a government endorsement mood ring that sends out an alert if you start thinking about protesting to a party.

 Karen getting her vaccine. Hi there. So my friends told me to ask for the Pfizer. Can I get some of that please? Well, you're in luck. That's the one I have. Okay, great. And I also heard that some of them have the government tracking devices so I don't want any with that in it. Okay, good. Because that's none of them. Sweetheart, are you serious? Have you been on Facebook? Okay, so did you want the vaccine or what are we doing here? Well, of course, I don't want it. It's being forced upon me. Kind of like jury duty. Ma'am, if you don't want it, I don't have to give it to you. Is that a trick saying you people can tase me when I try to leave? What? Oh, nothing. That's just a little stay-at-home mom humor. And I also want to get those medicines that Donald Trump had. I heard those are good too. Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. We don't actually have access to that. Oh, whatever. All right, inject me with the government aids. Go ahead. There you go. Let's go ahead and schedule your second shot. I beat COVID. Oh, ma'am, please put your mask back on. We still have to... Oh, my friends so meet the second vaccine to scan.
